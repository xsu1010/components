# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

This is a sample web component library, built with [Lit](https://lit.dev/).

## Getting Started

To get started, install the component bundle:

<Source dark code={`
npm install @xsu1010/components
`}/>

## Usage

This library provides two simple components: a button and an input field.

Its theming is based on a CSS variable approach, which allows for a multi-brand setup by simply swapping the CSS file to obtain the desired look and feel.

To import the components, first you need to import the tokens according to which brand you want to use.

For example, here's how to import them into a CSS file

<Source dark language="css" code={`
/* styles.css */

/* Main brand */
@import "@xsu1010/components/dist/src/tokens/main.css";
/* Secondary brand */
@import "@xsu1010/components/dist/src/tokens/sub.css";
`}>
</Source>

Now, you can start importing the components into the project!

<Source language="html" dark code={`
<script>
  import TestButton from "@xsu1010/components/button";
  import TestInput from "@xsu1010/components/input";
</script>

<!-- If you imported the main brand -->
<div class="main-brand">
  <test-button>Button label</test-button>
  <test-input label="Label"></test-input>
</div>

<!-- If you imported the secondary brand -->
<div class="sub-brand">
  <test-button>Button label</test-button>
  <test-input label="Label"></test-input>
</div>
  `}/>

Check the sidebar for further documentation on the components. You can also change the brand theming on the top bar.

Thank you so much for checking this out!
